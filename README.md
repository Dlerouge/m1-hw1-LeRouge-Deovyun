## About Me ##

My name is De'ovyun LeRouge and I am from Smithfield, North Carolina. My favorite thing to do is read books and I especially like the fantasy, romance, and paranormal genre's. I collect special editions as well as first editions and add them to my personal collection. I live in a tiny home and it is becoming apparent that I have more books than what I know what to do with, so I'm taking a small break from buying books in series that I haven't started. Wish me luck with that, everytime I say that I'm not going to buy any new books, I always end up at Barnes and Nobles.

## Past Coding Experience ##

I have my bachelors degree in Information Technology and the school I went to mainly focused on software rather than networking. I learned Java, C++, C#, HTML, and CSS. Out of all of those, I will say that HTML and CSS are my favorite which is why I decided to get my masters in Web Design. I am a middle school coding teacher and I primarily focus on JavaScript for my App Development and Game Development class and HTML and CSS for my Web Development class.

## Career Goals ##

1. Obtain my masters degree in Web Design
2. Create a Portfolio
3. Find a job in my field that is year round
4. Live a long and happy life while working up the ladder at my new job.
